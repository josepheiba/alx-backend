## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Parametrize Flask templates** to display different languages.
- **Infer the correct locale** based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- **Localize timestamps** to display them according to the user's locale.

## Requirements

- Your project files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **python3** (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** style (version 2.5).
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All your `*.py` files should be executable.
- All your modules should have documentation that can be retrieved with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- All your classes should have documentation that can be retrieved with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.
- All your functions and methods should have documentation that can be retrieved with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.
- Documentation should be more than just a simple word; it should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
